    <h1><b>Lahmacun</b></h1>
    <img src="images/lahmacun.png" alt="A lahmacun" width="700">
    <p>This Turkish-style pizza is a Turkish flatbread layered with a fresh sauce composed of tomatoes, sweet bell peppers, and minced lamb cooked with a flavorful selection of Mediterranean spices. It is normally garnished with fresh salad and a creamy garlic sauce and or a tangy, zesty, hot red pepper sauce. It is a really light meal, yet filling and flavorful. I find it worth the time to make if I can't get it from my favorite Turkish bakery in my old neighborhood in Amsterdam. For the best flavor, make the topping the night before you make the pizza.</p>

    <h2><b>Steps</b></h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Make lamb sauce: Combine onion, parsley, bell peppers, basil, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, paprika, coriander seed, and cumin. Pulse until vegetables are finely chopped. Add tomatoes and process until mixture is a thick puree.

</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add lamb, pureed vegetable mixture, and tomato paste; mix well. Cook and stir until lamb is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in cayenne pepper and salt to taste. Transfer mixture to a shallow baking dish to cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Make dough: Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1 cup warm water. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and stir well. Add 1/2 cup water and oil to yeast mixture and pour over flour mixture. Use your hands to mix dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.

</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball and transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover with a wet towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Remove lamb sauce from the refrigerator and allow to come up to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down, transfer it to a floured work surface, and cut into 10 portions. Shape each portion into a round. Flatten each round with your hand; use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a 10-inch circle. The dough should be thin, like a crepe. Place the rounds on parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Stir lamb sauce and spoon it onto a dough round. Spread it thinly to the edges and press down lightly so it sticks. Place on the prepared baking sheets.

</li>
        <li>Bake pizzas on the lowest oven rack in the preheated oven until the edges are a light tan color, 8 to 10 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool. The pizzas can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 3 months. To reheat, place pizzas in a 350 degrees F oven (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assamble lahmacun: Squezze some lemon to the lahmacun then add some parsley, and roll up to eat.</li>
